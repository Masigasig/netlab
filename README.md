WorkFlow and shit for our productivity and collaboration :
    Forked our repo first then bala kana kung ano gawin mo don sa repo mo tas pag uupload nyo na yung changes sa
    main repo "git pull --rebase" nyo muna yung branch sa forked repo tas saka nyo push sa main repo, linear lang dapat
    ang mangyayari sa git history natin.

    ps. you can use "git commit --amend --no-edit" kung may hahabol kang changes sa commit mo it's useful command search about it.

    sa commit message naman ket ganto nalang: "Type: Purpose" for example "chore: update dependecies" 
    
    Type:       Purpose:
    feat        Intorduce a new feature
    fix         Fixes bug
    docs        Changes to documentation only
    style       Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)-no logic
    refactor    Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
    test        Adding or updating test
    chore       Routing tasks like build scripts, configs, or dependecy update
    build       Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
