WorkFlow and shit for our productivity and collaboration :
    Forked our repo first then bala kana kung ano gawin mo don sa repo mo pag mag susubmit ng pull req keep your commit
    less as possible but not that it's one commit, I mean yung useful commit lang para madali makita kung ano yung changes
    git squash mo para matanggal yung unecessary commit at masama don sa ibang commit: watch the firt video here it's
    highly recommended for proffesional future carrer as programmer lol, ako na mag aaccept ng PR code review ko muna.

    ps. you can use "git commit --amend --no-edit" kung may hahabol kang changes sa commit mo its useful command search about it.
